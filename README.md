# 2D-Heat-Diffusion-Solution-with-Finite-Difference
The object of this project is to solve the 2D heat equation using finite difference method. It’s a MATLAB code that can solve for different materials such as (copper, aluminum, silver, etc….) or it allows the user to add his own material by entering the thermal conductivity factor, specific heat and density. Many different boundary conditions that are fixed with time "Dirichlet Conditions" can be applied. It solves also for the steady-state temperature of the plate and tell the user the time this plate will take to reach this steady-state with an error tolerance selected before by the user. The accuracy of the solution will depend mainly on the number of nodes in x and y directions that can be selected also before meshing and start iterating for solution. The code can solve the time-derivative part of the equation with 2 ways (Euler and 2nd order Runge-Kutte) and the space-derivatives with central finite difference  Finally, after solution, Graphical simulation in time appears to show how the heat diffuses throughout the plate within time interval chosen.
